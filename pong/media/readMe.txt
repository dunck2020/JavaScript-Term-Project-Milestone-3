    Pong Game
    Players will battle a computer AI.  Use the up and down arrow keys to move 
    your paddle.  Speed will increase with each contact of the ball.  
    Future developments include the ability for 2 players and ability to win
    the game.  Current issues include a random resetBall() function is called
    for no apparent reason.  I will continue to debug and solve the issue.
